1. 	Create new sensor/device
	Creating, or registering, a device in EdgeX Foundry is required for EdgeX to:
		● Become aware of the existence of the device
		● Be able to receive data from the device
		● Be able to send commands to the device (if it supports commands)
		● Understand what type of data the device will generate
		● Understand how and in what format the device sends data / receives commands. For example:
			○ What protocol is used?
			○ What types of data is supported (temp, humidity, vibrations/sec, etc.)?
			○ What format does the data come in (Int64, Str, etc.)?
			
	1. 1. Device profiles
		The sensor cluster, which will be generating temperature and humidity data, will be created
	using Postman with the following steps:
		● Create value descriptors (optional)
		● Upload the device profile
		● Create the device
	Each step will include the same IP address - that of the host, and a port number. The port
	number determines which microservice is targeted with each command. For example:
		● 59880: edgex-core-data (optional)
		● 59881: edgex-core-metadata
		● 59882: edgex-core-command
